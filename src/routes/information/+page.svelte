		From the 18th to the 20th of July, the Berlin University of the Arts invites you to the Rundgang
		â€“ Open Days. Workshops, studios and rehearsal rooms of the colleges of Fine Arts, Architecture, Media
		and Design, Music and Performing Arts as well as the Inter-University Centre for Dance Berlin, the
		Jazz Institute Berlin and the Berlin Career College open their doors at the end of the academic year.
		From painting, sculpture, and performance to design sketches, fashion shows, and film screenings
		to concerts, dance, and sound installations, students will show the results and processes of their
		artistic work. Everyone who would like to get to know the University as a place of encounter and
		discourse for the arts and sciences is invited to the Rundgang. In addition, a wide range of advisory
		services offers prospective students a concrete insight into the diverse range of courses offered
		by the Berlin University of the Arts.
